    "\n",
    "## **1. Multiclass Equal Sampling**\n",
    "- **Classes**: Goal, No_event, Yellow card, Direct free-kick.\n",
    "- **Clipping Strategy**:\n",
    "  - Goal was the least frequent event, occurring 27 times across 23 matches.\n",
    "  - To ensure balance, 27 samples were taken for each class.\n",
    "  - Equal representation was maintained across all classes.\n",
    "- **Splitting**:\n",
    "  - 80% of the samples were used for prototype building.\n",
    "  - 20% of the samples were used for evaluation.\n",
    "  - The process was repeated with the split reversed (20% for prototype building and 80% for evaluation).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Multiclass Unequal Sampling**\n",
    "- **Classes**: Goal, No_event, Yellow card, Direct free-kick, Penalty, Red card.\n",
    "- **Clipping Strategy**:\n",
    "  - Added Penalty and Red card classes to the dataset.\n",
    "  - Samples were imbalanced due to the varying frequency of events:\n",
    "    - Penalty and Red card were rare events (3 samples for Red card, 4 samples for Penalty across 23 matches).\n",
    "    - Other classes had more samples, leading to an unequal distribution.\n",
    "- **Splitting**:\n",
    "  - 80% of the samples were used for prototype building.\n",
    "  - 20% of the samples were used for evaluation.\n",
    "  - The split was reversed (20% for prototype building and 80% for evaluation) for additional testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Multiclass Sliding Window Sampling**\n",
    "- **Classes**: Red card, Penalty.\n",
    "- **Clipping Strategy**:\n",
    "  - Focused on rare events (Red card and Penalty) due to their limited occurrence in 23 matches (3 samples for Red card, 4 samples for Penalty).\n",
    "  - Applied a sliding window approach to augment the dataset:\n",
    "    - Generated additional clips by sliding ±2 seconds around the event timestamps.\n",
    "    - This increased the number of samples for these rare classes.\n",
    "- **Splitting**:\n",
    "  - 80% of the augmented samples were used for prototype building.\n",
    "  - 20% of the augmented samples were used for evaluation.\n",

    "- **Equal Sampling** ensured balanced representation across classes but was limited to four classes.\n",

    "## 6. Evaluation\n",
    "### Few-Shot Approach:\n",
    "- Prototype-based few-shot classification:\n",
    "  - Each class is represented by a mean feature vector (prototype).\n",

    "| Dataset Configuration | ResNet-50 Accuracy | R(2+1)D Accuracy | Performance Gap |\n",
    "|----------------------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|\n",
    "| **Equal Samples** | 56.25% | 50.00% | ResNet-50 +6.25% |\n",

    "| **Sliding Window** | 28.79% | 39.39% | R(2+1)D +10.60% |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Major Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Model Behavior Reversal\n",
    "- **Equal samples**: ResNet-50 outperformed R(2+1)D significantly\n",
    "- **Unequal samples**: ResNet-50 maintained superiority with larger margin\n",
    "- **Sliding window**: R(2+1)D showed recovery and outperformed ResNet-50\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Class-Specific Patterns\n",
    "- **Yellow_card**: Consistently best-performing class across most configurations\n",
    "- **Goal detection**: Varied dramatically between models and datasets\n",
    "- **Rare events** (Red_card, Penalty): Complete failure in most cases (0% accuracy)\n",
    "- **no_event**: Persistent challenge across all configurations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Impact of Sample Strategy\n",
    "- **Reversed sampling** (5 prototypes → 12 test) showed different behavior than traditional few-shot learning\n",
    "- **Larger test sets** revealed model limitations more clearly\n",
    "- **Class imbalance** severely affected both models' generalization capability\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Temporal Augmentation Effects\n",
    "- **Sliding window augmentation** helped R(2+1)D more than ResNet-50\n",
    "- **Direct_free-kick** detection improved dramatically in R(2+1)D (91.67% accuracy)\n",
    "- **Penalty and Red_card** augmentation didn't translate to classification success\n",
    "\n",
    "### Most Problematic Class Confusions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Across All Configurations:\n",
    "1. **no_event → other classes**: Consistent misclassification pattern\n",
    "2. **Goal ↔ Direct_free-kick**: Mutual confusion in most scenarios\n",
    "3. **Rare events → common classes**: Red_card and Penalty often misclassified as Goal or Yellow_card\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodological Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strengths of Reversed Sample Strategy:\n",
    "- **Larger evaluation sets** provide more reliable performance estimates\n",
    "- **Better understanding** of model generalization capabilities\n",
    "- **Real-world applicability** where test data exceeds training data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations Revealed:\n",
    "- **Prototype quality** becomes critical with limited training samples\n",
    "- **Class imbalance** effects are amplified in few-shot scenarios\n",
    "- **Temporal augmentation** shows mixed results and requires careful implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **For balanced datasets**: ResNet-50 shows superior few-shot learning capability\n",
    "2. **For imbalanced datasets**: Consider ensemble approaches or specialized loss functions\n",
    "3. **For temporal data**: R(2+1)D benefits more from sliding window augmentation\n",
    "4. **For rare event detection**: Alternative strategies beyond simple augmentation needed\n",
    "\n",
    "The reversed sampling strategy reveals that traditional few-shot learning assumptions may not hold when dealing with imbalanced sports event detection, particularly for rare events like red cards and penalties."
